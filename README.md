## Model View Controller Film Site Project

Week 8 Homework for SkillDistillery

### Overview

Building upon the week 7 project, my partner and I have developed a Spring application
that updates the database from a website. A user can find film by ID and keyword. The user can also create a film.
Deletions and Updates to the list of films are only possible on user created films. This preserves the integrity of the database.


### Concepts

	Prevent SQL Injection using PreparedStatement and bind variables.

	Java:
		Interfaces

    Command Objects

	SQL:
		SELECT
		JOIN ON
		LIKE
		? : bind variable
		Pattern Matching

	JDBC:
		Object-Relational Mapping
		PreparedStatement
		ResultSet
		Driver
